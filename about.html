                <p>LANY ( an acronym for "Los Angeles New York" ) are an American pop rock
                    band from Los Angeles. LANY were formed in March 2014 when Paul Jason
                    Klein, who had a small solo career, flew to Nashville to meet up with friends
                    Jake Goss and Les Priest. Previously, Goss and Priest had a separate project
                    by the name of WRLDS, but this was discontinuedafter the formation of LANY.
                    The following month they anonymously uploaded two songs, "Hot Lights" and "Walk
                    Away", to their SoundCloud account with zero followers in order to differentiate
                    between their old and new projects. In an interview, Klein explains that after
                    the release of these singles, they began receiving emails from record labels within
                    six days, of which he still does not know how they found the music.Their debut EP,
                    Acronyms, followed later that year, with the song "ILYSB" generating significant
                    interest online. Singles "Made in Hollywood" and "Bad, Bad, Bad"
                    soon followed, along with the reveal of their identities.</p>
